## Dataset Overview

The `Column_PBR_dataset_ICEE_2024` dataset is intended to support research on the optimization of microalgae cultivation in column photobioreactors. The dataset includes variables such as:

- **Microalgae Species:** The specific type of microalgae used in the cultivation experiment.
- **Year:** The year the data was collected.
- **Location:** The geographical location of the experiment, including latitude and longitude.
- **Reactor Dimensions:** Diameter and height of the column photobioreactor.
- **Flow Pattern:** The design of the photobioreactor, categorized as bubble, split column airlift, internal loop airlift, or internal loop airlift with gas separator, etc.
- **Reactor Volume:** The total volume of the reactor in cubic meters.
- **Biomass Productivity:** The maximum biomass productivity recorded in milligrams per liter per day (mg/L*day).
- **Biomass Concentration:** The maximum biomass concentration recorded in milligrams per liter (mg/L).

## File Descriptions
